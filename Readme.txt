My name is Christian HÃ¤usser and I am a Application Engineer for Railway application. I have done a litte bit data science in a previous program.
I have coding experince in c, c# and Python as well as R.
I'm interested to get to know to machine learning algorithms. The use of this knowledge later on at my work seems to be limited for the moment. 
But I want to do this program to obtain new knowledge which I can use for my current Job or antoher in future.
